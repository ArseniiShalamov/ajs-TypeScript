# ajs-TypeScript

Small **TypeScript** exercises and demos (types, interfaces, generics, OOP basics).  
Built with **Webpack** and tested with **Jest**.

> This repo is a collection of learning tasks â€” short, focused pieces of code rather than a single app.

## Tech stack
- TypeScript
- Webpack (bundling)
- Jest (unit tests)

## Getting started

```bash
# 1) Install dependencies
